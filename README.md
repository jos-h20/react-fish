# Catch of the Day
React tutorial project from Wes Bos


This is a build production of Wes Bos's tutorial I followed along with. 

It connects to firebase with Facebook user authentication.  

You can check it out at https://jos-h20.github.io/react-fish

Enter the store with a random name, sign in with Facebook, you will be assigned that store.

Have fun and play around with it!
